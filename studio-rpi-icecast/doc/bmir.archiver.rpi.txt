Instructions for preparing a Raspberry Pi model 3
with wired RJ45 internet and Wi-Fi
using Raspbian Stretch Lite 

AD 2019-0407
--------------------------------------------

Prereqs
	Linux laptop
		gparted
		etcher-electron
	SDCard-to-USB adapter

Download latest raspbian lite zip file to linux laptop
	From: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	Example: 2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip

	Do not unzip

Prepare sdcard media on linux laptop
	Obtain some media adapter for Micro SD cards
		such as Sandisk ImageMate 5-in-1 reader
	Insert Micro SD to the adapter, plug into laptop

Use gparted to delete partitions
	BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO DELETE YOUR LAPTOP HARD DRIVES!!!
	su - to root
	gparted &
	In the UI upper right, select the SD card.  
		For example, /dev/sdb
		Confirm expected total size of SD card (usually 32GB or less)
	In the main panel, for each allocated partition:
		Right-click-> Unmount (if mounted)
		Right-click-> Delete
	Repeat for all existing partitions
	When all partitions are deleted, click Green Checkmark at top.
	Confirm all SD card storage is now unallocated.
	Exit gparted.
	Exit root.

Remove the SDCard adapter from your laptop
	Wait 10 secs
	Reconnect the SDCard adapter to your laptop

Flash raspbian zip to SDCard using etcher-electron 
	Ensure you are NOT root user
	etcher-electron &
	At left, click 'Select Image'
		Navigate to Raspbian Lite zip file (do not unzip)
	In center, ensure the autodetected storage device size is correct.
	At right, click Flash
		Enter laptop user password
	Wait patiently for 100% completion

Once again, remove the SDCard adapter from your laptop
	Wait 10 secs
	Reconnect the SDCard adapter to your laptop

Confirm two new file systems are mounted to the laptop
		ls /media/<user>/
			/boot
			/rootfs

Optional:  Copy utilities, zips, and other personalization files
	to the SDCard on your laptop for use in the RPi.

	To enable SSH listener on the RPi, issue this as non-root:
		touch /boot/ssh

		Example: touch /media/USER/boot/ssh

	FOR DEBUG ONLY, NOT FOR PRODUCTION...
	To enable Wi-Fi password-protected access on the RPi, 
	create and edit file
		/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf
	with these contents (or similar for your country, security type, etc)
		country=US
		ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
		update_config=1

		network={
		    ssid="YOUR_WIFI_NETWORK_NAME"
		    scan_ssid=1
		    psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
		    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
		}

	Example: cp -p ~/personal/dl/raspberry.pi/server-in-a-box/boot-dir/wpa_supplicant.conf  /media/USER/boot/

	To enable password-free ssh from your laptop to RPI,
	copy your authorized_keys file to /media/<user>/boot

	To setup icecast2, streamripper, and all utility scripts,
		Download to your laptop https://github.com/sagittandy/bmir-archive-recorders
		Copy folder studio-rpi-icecast to /media/USER/boot/

Your SDCard is now ready to unmount from the laptop
	and install into a powered-off RPi.

Placed in Mod 3 rPI with wired ethernet.
rPI booted slowly and established two enet connections (one wired and one wireless)

ip -4 address show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 192.168.10.114/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 192.168.10.113/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global wlan0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Confirm SSH works to both.

- - - - -
Changed pi password to <YOUR_PI_PASSWORD>
Changed root password to <YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD>

apt-get update
apt-get -y dist-upgrade
shutdown -r now

SSH in again.  Confirm no further OS updates.

- - - - -
apt-get -y install zip

- - - - -
SSH keys (on RPI) if you have a zip available from earlier RPIs...
mkdir /home/pi/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/pi/.ssh
unzip the contents of dot.ssh.rpi.2019-0407-2335.zip in the .ssh folder

### Move /boot/authorized_keys to /home/pi/.ssh/
### cp authorized_keys /home/pi/.ssh/  

SSH in again.  Confirm no password required.

Otherwise, start from scratch:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	etc

- - - - -
Set timezone to US PACIFIC 
	timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles

- - - - -
Edit /etc/hostname as root
	Change raspberrypi to your new hostname
	Example: bmirpi7

- - - - -
Edit /etc/hosts as root
Set hostname of THIS RPI. Change raspberrypi to your new hostname
	Example: bmirpi7
Set hostname + IP of target cloud server (destination for uploading MP3s)
	Example: 1.2.3.4 dobmir

- - - - -
For uploader and autossh
	On cloud server dobmir,
	create new user 'pi'
		adduser pi
			password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
	if you have a zip available from earlier RPIs...
		unzip dot.ssh.rpi.2019-0407-2335.zip into a tmp folder
		cp -p authorized_keys.pi.dingx to /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys
		This authorized pi@rpi to ssh into pi@dobmir without password.
	Otherwise, copy id_rsa.pub from the RPI .ssh/authorized_hosts folder.
	Ensure you can sh from pi@rpi to pi@dobmir

Install and setup apps, according to instructions in each folder:
	icecast2/
	streamripper/
	autossh/
	uploader/

- - - - -
Set up UFW (Ubuntu Firewall)
	ufw/

- - - - -
Monitor (uploads stats HTML file to cloud server every 2 mins)
	monitor/

- - - - -
Test 
	icecast2 and streamripper
		Run liquidsoap from some laptop to
		stream MP3s to the RPI
		ensure MP3 files are stored on RPI filesystem
	Uploader
		ensure MP3s uploaded every 2 hours to dobmir
	Autossh
		ensure you can SSH to the cloud server dobmir into the RPI

TODOs: 
	SUPPRESS WIFI
	Start with a fresh new microSD, and repeat the setup steps.
	Prepare multiple fresh new microSDs and verify they can be swapped in.
	Buy or procure another RPI with wired ethernet.  Where is Nate's?

	Ask experts for advice:
	- Power: 
		How best to power the RPI highly available?
		RPI USB power to a 15 minute UPS  <== Mark recommends this.
		12v scooter battery with continuous external charger, USB power supply to RPI

	- Filesystem
		How to make the filesystem robust?
		Power glitches often corrupt the microSD filesystem	
		Make microSD read-only as much as possible?
		External USB memory stick for MP3 files?   <== Stuck here
		SSD drive for MP3 files?
