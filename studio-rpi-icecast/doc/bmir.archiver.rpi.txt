Prereqs
	Linux laptop
		gparted
		etcher-electron
	SDCard-to-USB adapter

Download latest raspbian lite zip file to linux laptop
	From: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	Example: 2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip

	Do not unzip

Prepare sdcard media on linux laptop
	Obtain some media adapter for Micro SD cards
		such as Sandisk ImageMate 5-in-1 reader
	Insert Micro SD to the adapter, plug into laptop

Use gparted to delete partitions
	BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO DELETE YOUR LAPTOP HARD DRIVES!!!
	su - to root
	gparted &
	In the UI upper right, select the SD card.  
		For example, /dev/sdb
		Confirm expected total size of SD card (usually 32GB or less)
	In the main panel, for each allocated partition:
		Right-click-> Unmount (if mounted)
		Right-click-> Delete
	Repeat for all existing partitions
	When all partitions are deleted, click Green Checkmark at top.
	Confirm all SD card storage is now unallocated.
	Exit gparted.
	Exit root.

Remove the SDCard adapter from your laptop
	Wait 10 secs
	Reconnect the SDCard adapter to your laptop

Flash raspbian zip to SDCard using etcher-electron 
	Ensure you are NOT root user
	etcher-electron &
	At left, click 'Select Image'
		Navigate to Raspbian Lite zip file (do not unzip)
	In center, ensure the autodetected storage device size is correct.
	At right, click Flash
		Enter laptop user password
	Wait patiently for 100% completion

Once again, remove the SDCard adapter from your laptop
	Wait 10 secs
	Reconnect the SDCard adapter to your laptop

Confirm two new file systems are mounted to the laptop
		ls /media/<user>/
			/boot
			/rootfs

Obtain a set of files to setup your RPI.
They are listed in studio-rpi-icecast/sdcard/setup.laptop.sh.
Place these files in folder studio-rpi-icacast/sdcard/.
They are:
	- two id_rsa files,
	- one authorized_keys file, and
	- one wpa_supplicant.conf file.

wpa_supplicant follows this pattern:

	country=US
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1

	network={
		ssid="YOUR_WIFI_NETWORK_NAME"
		psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
		key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
	}

As a NON-ROOT user on your laptop, run this script:

	./setup.laptop.sh

After successful completion,
your SDCard is now ready to unmount from the laptop
and install into a powered-off RPi.

- - - - -
Place the SDCard in a powered-off Mod 3 rPI with wired ethernet and USB memory stick.
Power-on.
RPI will boot slowly and establish two enet connections (one wired and one wireless).

Discover their IPs from your wifi router admin/console.
One is wired and one is Wi-Fi.

SSH to both IPs as user pi.  Use default password 'raspberry'.
Confirm SSH works to both interfaces.

- - - - -
As ROOT user on your RPI, run this script

	/boot/studio-rpi-icecast/sdcard/setup.rpi.sh <PASSWORD> <HOSTNAME> <REMOTE_PORT>

	where
		<PASSWORD> will be used for both root and pi
		<HOSTNAME> will be the hostname of the RPI
		<REMOTE_PORT> is the SSh port number used by autossh (10020 thru 10029 inclusive)

After successful execution, reboot via shutdown -r now.

SSH in again.  Confirm no further OS updates.

- - - - -
As user ROOT on the RPI, run the following script...

	cd /home/pi/studio-rpi-icecast/post.setup.rpi.sh

- - - - -
After completion, please reboot via shutdown -r now.

The complete archiver software package should start and run successfully!

- - - - -
Test 
	icecast2 and streamripper
		Run liquidsoap from some computer to stream MP3s to the RPI
		ensure MP3 files are stored on USB filesystem
	Monitor
		ensure the web page on dobmir is updated every minute
	Uploader
		ensure MP3s uploaded every 2 hours to dobmir
	Autossh
		ensure you can SSH to the cloud server dobmir into the RPI

Production setup:
	Redundancy: Prepare several SDCARDs with different hostnames/remote port numbers.
	Power: Use a commercial 120vac UPS, with Canakit's 2.5A USB power adapter.
